To have the opportunity to work at such a fast-paced company (since I took the offer in March 2020, Livongo's stock has burgeoned almost 100 points as of August 2020) makes me feel so fortunate, especially with Livongo converting my internship from in person to remote. Livongo "empowers people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives", and is a digital health management service for diabetes, weight loss, and hypertension (and perhaps many more chronic conditions in the future :)). It's honestly such a simple, "why didn't anyone else think of this", idea -- basically connecting all these health digital devices (blood sugar meter, blood pressure cuff, and weight scale) to the cloud and creating engaging personalized information, with users even being able to contact trained health professionals if particular metrics (like an individual's blood sugar levels) are out of the ordinary. Working at a company that has such a good mission is such a fulfilling experience; it motivates my coworkers and I everyday to be excited about the things we do. </p1> <br> <br> <div align="center"> <img src="../assets/img/food_logging.jpg"> <p5 style="font-size: small;">Food logging project goodness: <br> Users can take an image/select an image from their gallery, label their meal, add a short note describing what they ate/ anything else, and view all their past food logs in a singular location. </p5> </div> <br> <p1> I'm currently on the Mobile Engineering team on the Android subteam. I've been working on the food logging feature of our native Android app, which enables users to record the meals that they eat through taking pictures and joting down a few notes -- almost like a daily food diary. It's been such a great learning experience, from learning about the rigorous testing practices in place (i.e. unit testing), to learning about the SDLC and all the technologies that typical software engineers use on a daily basis (like Jira, Confluence, and, of course, Git). So far, I've had 3 primary takeaways. One being, of course, the technical skills I've accrued that will become so valuable down the road. The second being that I've learned how/when to ask for help. Before, I'd definitely say that I was hesitant to do so, as it "showed" that I was "incompetent", but I'm realizing how foolish that notion is and seeing senior devs asking each other for advice all the time. And lastly, I've learned that nothing is ever simple at face value. There exists so many hidden layers behind implementing a spec or feature, and you can pretty much add a couple hours to your Jira "time-remaining" field as things will inevitably come up and require your attention. I've made the analogy of software engineering being like an iceberg (as cliche as it sounds). All these roadblocks will come up, no matter how hard you try -- a user will try tapping a button multiple times, or upload a video instead of an image -- all of these random events that you, as the software dev, have to account for. </p1> <br> <br> <div align="center"> <img src="../assets/img/iceberg.jpg"> <p5 style="font-size: small;">My self-coined "iceberg model" </p5> </div> <br> <p1> I've also been able to engage with people beyond my particular subteam, including weekly hangouts with the amazing iOS folks, as well as simply interacting with those in other teams, including those in Backend, Design, Content, and Product. Getting a sense of everything out there -- including potential roles I could be interested in down the road -- has been worthwhile experience. I'm surrounded by so much talent; one of my aims as I round out my time here at Livongo is to further engage with my coworkers by reaching out and saying hello, and perhaps querying around and asking about what they do on a daily basis to get a better sense of what it's like out there. Because who knows: I may very well pivot careers and find my true calling somewhere else :). </p1> <h1>Stanford Human-Computer Interaction Lab</h1> <h4>CS Undergraduate Research Intern; Summer 2019</h4> <p1>In summer of 2019, I interned at the Stanford CS Department through the Human-Computer Interaction Lab. I worked on an Android app to help gamify fitness by incentivizing users with stories to nudge them into consistently exercising. I really enjoyed my time here as I was able to not only develop my skills as a software developer, but also meet my incredible co-interns/mentors who are all special in their unique ways. Plus, it was gratifying to stay on the beautiful Stanford campus over the summer without having to worry about p-sets or writing essays :). </p1> <br> <br> <div align="center"> <object data="/assets/img/curis_poster.pdf" type="application/pdf" width="700px" height="600px"> </object> <p2>The poster I presented at the end of the internship!</p2> </div> </div> </div> </header> </body> </html>
