                <p1>This past summer (2019), I interned at the Stanford CS Department through the Human-Computer Interaction Lab.
                    I worked on an Android app to help gamify fitness by incentivizing users with stories to nudge them into consistently
                    exercising. I really enjoyed my time here as I was able to not only develop my skills as a software developer, but 
                    also meet my incredible co-interns/mentors who are all special in their unique ways. Plus, it was gratifying to stay 
                    on the beautiful Stanford campus over the summer without having to worry about p-sets or writing essays :).
